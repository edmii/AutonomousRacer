Until now: 
*All work done until point 7 got discarded.
  Kept here only as part of the learning process of the project.






 1. Initial Planning Phase
🗓️ July 16–20

Defined overall project goal:

Train an AI agent with reinforcement learning in Unity to drive a car realistically and generalize to unseen tracks.

Selected platform:

Unity 3D (using ML-Agents), with potential integration of PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), reward shaping, and domain randomization.


🟩 2. Unity Setup and Environment Creation
🗓️ July 26–28

Created first race track:

Used Simple Roads – Free Unity asset pack.
Assembled prefabs (curves, straights, etc.) to build a basic race track layout.

Problem: How to cut a prefab or modify road elements
→ Solution: Learned that modifying prefab instances requires unpacking or duplicating them in Unity.

Created the ground:

Added a plane to serve as base terrain under the track.

🟩 3. Car Prefab and Physics
🗓️ July 28–29

Imported car prefab into Unity scene

Used a vehicle model with separated visual and functional parts.

Problem: Couldn’t add collider directly to visual tire
→ Solution: Learned that realistic vehicles use WheelCollider components on invisible empty GameObjects positioned precisely at the wheel hubs. The visual wheels follow via code (e.g., WheelCollider.GetWorldPose()).


4. 🔧 Vehicle Physics & WheelCollider Setup 
🗓️ July 29-30

Added 4 empty GameObjects for WheelColliders: front/rear, left/right.
Aligned colliders with visual tires.
Attached WheelCollider components and configured:
Suspension, radius, and friction
Rigidbody mass and center of mass for realistic handling
Created CarController.cs:
Maps input to steering (front wheels), torque (rear wheels), and visual wheel pose sync.
Lowered center of mass via script.






5. 🕹️ Input System Integration 
🗓️ July 30

Switched to Unity’s new Input System
Reused existing InputSystem_Actions asset.
Bound Move action (Vector2) to WASD + left stick.
Updated CarController to read moveInput.x for steering and -moveInput.y for throttle.

✅ Steering (A/D)
✅ Acceleration (W)
✅ Braking (S)

🛠 Fixed:
Reversed throttle (inverted Y)
Car rolling backward → added brake torque when idle
Rear wheels not grounded → fixed collider size and position


🟩 6. Track Design Enhancement with Join the Dots
🗓️ August 19

To improve flexibility in track creation and prepare multiple training/test environments:
Implemented the Join the Dots – 3D Shapes & Roads Unity asset
→ https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/join-the-dots-3d-shapes-roads-313840

This tool allows building modular tracks by connecting nodes (dots), generating roads, curves, and shapes procedurally.
Benefit: Reduces manual prefab placement (as with Simple Roads) and supports rapid iteration of diverse circuits, which is crucial for:
Curriculum learning (progressively harder tracks)

Domain randomization (ensuring generalization to unseen layouts)















6.5. Discarded all previous cars, tracks or physics and decided to implement...









7) NWH Vehicle Physics 2 (NVP2)
🗓️ Aug 25–30

Imported NVP2 v13.6, drove demo sports car to study controller/handling.

Physics Features:
Custom Wheel Model: Integrated wheel physics for realistic grip, slip angles, and combined friction.
Suspension & Tire Simulation: Spring/damper dynamics with advanced friction curves and slip handling.
Drivetrain System: Engine torque → clutch → gearbox → differential → wheels.
Surface Detection: Road type tagging (e.g., asphalt, gravel, grass) affects grip, skidmarks, and effects.
Effects: Skidmarks, tire smoke, particles, and sound feedback tied to wheel slip.
Input & Control: Uses Unity’s Input System (via scene’s Input Provider).


Structure:
VehicleController.cs – central brain, ties together subsystems (engine, suspension, effects).
Modules: Engine, Transmission, Differential, Brakes, Steering, etc.
WheelComponent: Each wheel has physics parameters (friction, suspension travel, camber).
GroundDetection: Reads surface tags/materials for physics and effects.
SceneManager / InputProvider: Handles input mapping and player controls.

Problem: Magenta materials (URP mismatch).
Fix: Edit → Rendering → Materials → Convert to URP.

Input broke when copying vehicle alone.
Fix: Also copy demo _SceneManager (input provider).

Skidmarks missing on custom surfaces.
Fix: Tag road mesh as Road (per Ground Detection).











8) First Complete Track + Invisible Boundaries
🗓️ Aug 25-30

Built track with Modular Lowpoly Track Roads. (1.)
Added invisible boundary colliders around the track: MeshColliders on walls (renderer off). (2.)


							2.
9) Raycast Sensors — Implementation & Tuning
🗓️ Aug 31

9.1 Sensor Rig & Visibility
Added RaycastSensorRig child to the car; drew rays with gizmos.

Problem: Rays not visible in Play.
Fix: Use OnDrawGizmos/OnDrawGizmosSelected and enable Gizmos in Scene/Game; selecting the object shows the fan.



9.2 RaycastSensor.cs (finalized)

Geometry: forward fan of rays; per-ray ranges (3-tier).
Normalization: each Distances[i] is 0..1, normalised by that ray’s own max range.

Key fields & current settings:

Rays: 13 (odd → true center)
FOV: 170°
Origin offset: (0, 0, 0.3), Height: 0.25 m
Three-tier ranges:
Side: 50 m
Middle: 80 m
Middle half-width: 3 (three rays per side use middle range)
Center (straight ahead): 160 m
Detectable Layers: TrackBoundary
Hit Triggers: Off








9.3 Layer & Trigger Debug

Problem: Rays didn’t collide with walls.
Fix: Set Detectable Layers to include TrackBoundary (was “Nothing”); leave Hit Triggers = Off. Avoid Ignore Raycast layer.








Outputs:
Distances[] (normalised 0..1 per ray)
HitNormals[]
PerRayMax[] (exposed to know each ray’s absolute max if needed)


9.4 Helper Wrappers (robust API)

Index helpers: CenterIndex, LeftmostIndex, RightmostIndex.
Accessors: GetNormalizedDistance(i), GetCenterNormalizedDistance(), GetLeftOfCenter(k), GetRightOfCenter(k).
Angle helpers: GetRayAngleDeg(i), GetIndexForAngle(angleDeg), GetNormalizedByAngle(angleDeg).
Sector aggregate: GetSectorMin(angleDeg, halfWidthDeg) → returns the minimum (most dangerous) normalised distance in an angular window (great for rewards/safety).

Why: safer & clearer than raw indices; resilient to changes in rays/FOV; enables compact, invariant features.

9.5 Debugging UX

Console logger (RaycastSensorConsoleLog): prints normalised distances periodically.
On-screen HUD (RaycastSensorHUD): quick GUI to visualise 0..1 distances live.

9.6 Design Decisions (for RL)

Observation format: use normalised 0–1 distances (stable learning).
Number of rays: 13 chosen as sweet spot (accuracy vs. learning stability vs. compute).
Ranges: three-tier (side/middle/center) for close clearance + turn anticipation + long look-ahead.
Why not meters: meters are fine for logs; for PPO I preferred normalised inputs to avoid scale issues.

10) SimpleTrack + checkpoints
🗓️ Sept 1-3

Built SimpleTrack_v1: short closed loop for initial learning stability.
Boundaries: invisible MeshColliders on TrackBoundary layer (excluded from vehicle/kept for rays).
Checkpoints: placed sequential OnTrigger colliders (Checkpoint_0..N) following the driving direction.

Checkpoint system:
Scripts:

CheckpointTrigger.cs (on each checkpoint, isTrigger ON, optional Index).

CheckpointManager.cs (on Checkpoints parent): tracks order, laps, rewards/penalties; ignores repeats/backwards; optional lap wrap check.

Setup:
Put CheckpointManager on existing Track1/Checkpoints parent; it auto-finds child triggers and auto-indexes (or manual order).

Debug UX: console messages (OK -> i, WRONG -> j (expected k)).
Use: progress tracking, reward shaping (positive reward per new checkpoint), and optional episode termination on going backwards or missing checkpoints.

Episode rules (initial): end on boundary collision; optional time/step cap (Agent Max Step ~ 5000), not yet used.

11) Python/ML-Agents stack finalised & handshake
🗓️ Sept 1-3

Venv created at C:\Users\micci\Desktop\AutonomousRacer\MLAgentsEnv\mlagents-env with Python 3.10.8.
Upgraded tooling: pip, setuptools, wheel.
NumPy 1.23.5 installed as a wheel to avoid Windows build errors.

ML-Agents (Python) installed from GitHub release_23_tag (shows mlagents==1.2.0.dev0, mlagents_envs==1.2.0.dev0).

Installed PyTorch CUDA 12.1 build (cu121 index; cuDNN bundled).
Handshake: mlagents-learn connects (Communicator API 1.5.0), brain detected.


12) CarAgent + wiring + first training config
🗓️ Sept 1-3
Implemented CarAgent.cs:
Observations (15): 13 ray distances (0–1 normalized), speed (norm by 80 m/s), yaw-rate (norm by ±5 rad/s).

Actions (2 continuous): steer, accel/brake (axis where + = throttle, − = brake).

Behavior Parameters on the car:
Behavior Name: CarAgentParams (matches YAML).
Continuous Actions: 2, Discrete: 0, Model: None, Behavior Type: Default.
Vector Observation Space Size: 15 (fixed truncation warning).
Training YAML (car_ppo.yaml):

PPO; batch_size=1024, buffer_size=40960, learning_rate=3e-4, beta=5e-4, epsilon=0.2, lambd=0.95, num_epoch=3,

hidden_units=256, num_layers=2, normalize=true, gamma=0.99, time_horizon=128, summary_freq=5000, max_steps=2e6.

✅ Diary Update — ML Build Start
🗓️ November 6, 2025

13) ML Build Initialization — Neural Network Training Phase Begins

With the full Unity–ML Agents pipeline now stable and all telemetry, sensors, and reward systems integrated, the project is officially ready to begin the neural network training phase.

Environment Readiness

Unity environment fully configured with:

NWH Vehicle Physics 2 handling realistic car dynamics.

RaycastSensor (13 rays, 3-tier range) providing normalized 0–1 obstacle distances.

WheelTelemetry reading real-time friction, slips, lock/spin events, and “on track” status.

CheckpointManager tracking lap progress and rewardable milestones.

ML-Agents (Python + Unity) handshake confirmed.

All observation and action spaces verified, stable dimensions (15+).

Reward System (current iteration)

Positive: forward speed, smooth progress, staying on track, correct checkpoints.

Negative: slip, wheel lock/spin, proximity to walls, going off track, collisions.

Parameters tuned for first PPO run; rewards normalized and balanced to avoid bias collapse.


14) Training Script Added
  🗓️ November 6, 2025


Comprehensive Reward System and Training Documentation Added

Following the initialization of the ML build, the CarAgent now includes a complete reward system and finalized training setup documentation.

🧠 Implementation Summary

  Added a reward computation system directly in CarAgent, balancing progress, speed, traction, and obstacle avoidance.

  Verified all observation and action spaces for the upcoming PPO training phase.

  Tuned termination conditions for stability (crashes, off-track, max steps).

  Reward structure promotes smooth, forward, and track-bound driving while discouraging slip, lock, and collisions.

📄 Documentation Added — README.md

  A full ML-Agents Training Setup Guide was written to standardize the workflow for future iterations and reproducibility. It covers:

  Neural Network architecture (inputs, outputs, layers, normalization)

  Reward system (detailed logic, values, and rationale)

  Training configuration (hyperparameters, termination, checkpoints)

  How-to guide for starting and monitoring training sessions

  Tuning tips for performance and stability optimization

  Model export procedure (.onnx, .pt, and checkpoint usage)


Training Automation Script — train_model.bat

  A dedicated Windows batch script was created to streamline ML-Agents training sessions. The script automates the launch process for PPO training, ensuring consistent configuration and simplified execution.

  ⚙️ File: train_model.bat
  @echo off
  REM Training script for Autonomous Racer ML-Agents
  REM Make sure Unity is running with the environment before starting training

  cd MLAgentsEnv\mlagents-env\Scripts

  echo Starting ML-Agents training...
  echo Config: Config\Car_ppo.yaml
  echo Results will be saved to: results\car_v0

  call mlagents-learn Config\Car_ppo.yaml --run-id=car_v0 --force

  pause

🧩 Purpose & Usage

Automation: Launches the PPO trainer without requiring manual command input.

Reproducibility: Always runs with the same configuration (Car_ppo.yaml) and stores results under a unique run ID (car_v0).

Workflow: Ensures that Unity is already running the environment, then triggers the Python training session inside the correct virtual environment path (MLAgentsEnv\mlagents-env\Scripts).

Convenience: Displays run configuration and pauses at the end for review of logs or results.

This marks the completion of the ML training pipeline setup — Unity environment, reward system, PPO configuration, and now a one-click training launcher ready for execution.




15) Curriculum Learning Strategy Refinement (Time Horizon)
🗓️ November 10, 2025

Based on the need to balance stable initial learning (low variance) with complex long-term planning (low bias), a **staged approach for the PPO Time Horizon** was adopted:

* **Initial Phase (Simple Tracks):** The Time Horizon will be set to a **smaller value (e.g., 128 or 256 steps)**. This forces the agent to focus on **immediate rewards** and **short-term consequences**, facilitating the rapid, stable learning of basic skills like forward motion and crash avoidance.
* **Advanced Phase (Complex Tracks):** As the agent graduates to more complex, unseen circuits (via curriculum learning), the Time Horizon will be progressively **increased (e.g., 512, then 1024+ steps)**.
* **Goal:** A larger time horizon encourages the agent to consider **long-term goals** (e.g., the final lap bonus) and optimize sophisticated behaviors like **racing lines** and **corner setup**, crucial for high-performance driving.

This strategy ensures early stability while allowing for the development of advanced intelligence later in the training pipeline.

Advanced PPO Strategy: Staging Entropy (beta)

To further enhance the curriculum learning process, a staging strategy was also defined for the PPO Entropy Coefficient (beta = 5.0 \times 10^{-4}):

* **Initial Exploration Phase (Higher $beta):** The Entropy Coefficient will be set to a slightly **higher value** (e.g., $1.0 \times 10^{-3}) during the initial learning stages and on simple tracks. This increases the randomness of the agent's actions, heavily promoting **exploration** to quickly discover viable driving paths and avoid early local optima.
* **Refinement Phase (Decreasing beta):** As the agent masters basic skills and progresses to complex tracks, the beta value will be **gradually decreased** (or scheduled to decay).
* **Goal:** Lowering beta shifts the agent's priority from exploration to **exploitation**, focusing its learning on refining its discovered policy to be highly **deterministic** and consistent for maximizing lap times.


16)Complete ML-Agents Infrastructure Implementation

This session was dedicated to finalizing the complete ML-Agents infrastructure required for the main training phase.

* **Reward System Analysis:** The **complete mathematical formulation** for the 10-component reward system was finalized and documented in `REWARD_FORMULA_ANALYSIS.md`. The analysis confirmed that **Speed Rewards** dominate the positive signal and the **Off-Track Penalty** is the strongest negative signal (100x the positive on-track reward).

* **Action Application Implemented:** The core issue of agent inputs not reaching the car was addressed by implementing the `ApplyVehicleInputs()` method in `CarAgent.cs`. This method uses a **three-tier fallback system** (NWH Controller $\rightarrow$ Direct WheelController $\rightarrow$ Rigidbody Force) to ensure the actions (steer, throttle, brake) are applied to the vehicle.

* **Training Workflow Automation:** A comprehensive set of **PowerShell and Batch scripts** were created to automate all training scenarios: `train_model` (new run, `--force`), `train_model_resume` (`--resume`), and `train_model_parallel` (`--num-envs`).

* **Performance Optimization (CUDA/Parallel):** CUDA/GPU support was integrated into the training scripts for acceleration, and the parallel training infrastructure was enabled to allow running multiple environments simultaneously for faster data collection.

* **PPO Hyperparameter Finalization:** The PPO configuration (`Car_ppo.yaml`) was updated based on the curriculum strategy:
    * **Time Horizon** set to a smaller **128 steps** (from 512) for initial stability on simple tracks.
    * **Beta (Entropy)** set to a higher **1.0e-3** (from 5.0e-4) to encourage robust initial exploration.

* **Current Status & Next Step:** The infrastructure is fully documented and configured. The final immediate blocker is a known issue where the agent's inputs are still not properly affecting the vehicle (likely due to an incorrect reflection property name in `ApplyVehicleInputs`). **Debugging the vehicle input application is the highest priority.**
